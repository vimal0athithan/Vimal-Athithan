# About me
<!-- I am going to write about myself and my skills, hobbies, and interests. !-->
I am Vimal Athithan, currently pursuing my final year in Mechanical Engineering at SASTRA. My interests lie in robotics (ROS2, Gazebo), designing components using CAD software such as SolidWorks and Catia, and performing CFD analyses with Python and ANSYS. I also have experience with MATLAB. Let's stay in touch and contribute more. Cheers!
